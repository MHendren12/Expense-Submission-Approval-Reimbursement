In this class, students from various fields such as Computer Science and Information technology brought their skill and creativity into developing great projects that many people may find helpful with their business or daily lives.</p> 
                            <p>This project started out from simple idea.

The responsibility would be creating a system for expense pre-approval, reporting, post approval and reimbursement system. A key role in the development of this site was devoted to team of 6 people their names are Michael Hendren, Jon Calvert, Matt Papais, Shane Kuskowski Andre Mitchell and Marek Stolarczyk. Their hard work brought this simple idea into full working website called R.A.S.E.</p>
                            <p>R.A.S.E service was created for small businesses by allowing for self-management of revenues and expenses. Reporting expense has never been a straightforward process.
